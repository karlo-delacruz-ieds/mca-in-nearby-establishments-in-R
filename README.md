# Multiple Correspondence Analysis on Establishments Example
---
I would like to share this code that I used in my research entitled *Product Assortment Plan for Convenience Stores based on its Nearby Establishments*. 

In my study, I was able to create cluster stores with similar buying preferences from the customer. Then, I need to find the relationship between the collected kinds of nearby establishments surrounding the stores within 100 meter radius and the store cluster with similar sales. For this notebook, I employed **Multiple Correspondence Analysis** to easily see the relationship between categorical variables and identify what kind of establishments is associated to the cluster.

This code will serve as your template if you want to explore this field of research.

I hope this code could help you!
